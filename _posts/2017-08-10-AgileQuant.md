Came across this interesting study on Agile

[Quantitative Analysis of Agile Methods Study](https://www.infoq.com/articles/reifer-agile-study-2017)

Key Take aways from article:

1. Agile is firmly entrenched as the most commonly used approach to software development
1. Agile methods have reached a steady state in most firms embracing them and productivity improvements are stabilizing
1. Productivity increases are not being realized by those pursuing either large agile projects or enterprise-wide utilization
1. Agile methods improve the ability to meet schedule deadlines
1. Agile quality is better than traditional normsAgile methods continue to provide their users with a competitive advantage

Some of my thoughts on this:

1. **Agile is the way to go** - The clear focus on delivering customer value instead of artifacts, and the efficacy created in team by following agile.
1. **Integrate architecture** judiciously into Agile projects especially for larger projects. My previous article on architecture integration. [LAMA](http://ramachandran.io/lama) addresses this topic
1. **Avoid Agile treadmill** - Some companies using agile tend to push the agile teams into a constant delivery loop which does not take into account technical debt, integration of architecture, and even reflection for improvements. I will publish an article on how to improve this in the future.
1. **Embrace Automation incessantly** - Constantly look at your projects to automate everything that can be automated for the development life cycle. Unit Testing, Integration Testing, Performance Testing etc are all great candidates.
1. **Embrace DevOps & Continuous Delivery** - Containerization, AWS/Azure/Cloud and Automation tools have put so much power in the hands of the individual developer and enable more valuable collaboration between Dev and Ops.
