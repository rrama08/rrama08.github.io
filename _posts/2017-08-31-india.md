1. Product Mentality
The Indian software economy has long been very service based, providing outsourcing services to MNC companies. This has helped the economy to grow to this point. However Product mentality and approach is slowly starting to take hold and Indian companies are starting to build software and products for India and other countries.

2. Access to Cheap Internet and Mobile Data
The Indian service providers (Mobile, ISPs)  are proving cheap internet access to 100s of millions of Indians. This access means Indian society as a whole is moving towards Hyper-connected mode. In India traditional wired internet has been leap frogged by Mobile Data.

3. Dynamic Consumer
Indian consumer is very adaptive and dynamic. They are much more comfortable accessing the online and e-commerce platforms than ever before. More Indians will be using Uber Services than in US very soon.

4. Low Cost of Living
Cost of living in India is still low even after the large surges in property values. This will enable entrepreneurs to take risks and set up their own businesses.
