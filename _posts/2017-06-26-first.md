After a long time I am starting to publish some thoughts again. Much of the previous material is out dated. I have tried several platforms like blogger, wordpress.com etc, but never liked the linear format of blogging based on a date. Recently I came across couple of static blogging platforms and found Jekyll to be interesting especially due to the smooth integration with github and the availability of simple, content centric templates

I am organizing my new site with 2 sections. One an upfront sticky section with some ideas and thoughts that are relevant for longer period of time, and a blog section with a linear time series blog.
