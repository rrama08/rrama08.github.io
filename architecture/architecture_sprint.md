# Better Agile
I have been lately doing some thinking on a better approach for integration of holistic systems thinking and architecture into agile execution. The classic agile approaches favor "Emergent design" which is highly dependent on expert engineers, pervasive understanding & alignment of systems goals and startup like hunger and focus by the development team.

On the other hand, there are approaches like Scaled Agile (SAFE) and Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD) which have created elaborate systems to ensure that some architecture is integrated into the Agile process.

In my view both approaches have their drawbacks

*Drawbacks of Traditional Agile*
* Lack of Holistic systems thinking
* Lack of a unifying architecture vision and possible Directional misalignment between Agile teams
* Lack of ownership clarity on Architecture

Remember a system will always have an architecture. Whether it is a "Accidental" or "Intentional" architecture is something to be considered.

*Drawbacks of SAFE and Disciplined Agile Delivery*
* Complex and Intricate
* Process heavy with a lot of moving parts
* Abundance of roles
