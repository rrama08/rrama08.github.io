I wanted to create a quick and easy to remember framework that focuses on a set of qualities everyone who aspires to be in a leadership position in Technology can adopt and improve on a daily basis. In my view a framework is only effective if you can easily hold it in your mind and use it on a day to day basis till it becomes second nature. Hence an easy to remember mnemonic device called *VICTORI*. Here are the 7 Salient qualities for effective leadership in technology.

## Vision
> “I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal,
before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon
and returning him safely to the earth.” - John F. Kennedy

> "My vision is for a fully reusable rocket transport system between Earth and Mars that is able to re-fuel on Mars - this is very important - so you don't have to carry the return fuel when you go there" - Elon Musk

JFK's clearly articulated, compelling vision of putting a man on the moon is an archetype of a vision statement. The ability to establish a vision beyond what most people can see today is one of the most important qualities of a leader.

A leader can develop the ability to create a vision by *expansive thinking, reflection, and visualization*. An effective vision also will have an aligned strategy to execute that vision for the context in which the leader operates.

To improve your thinking with different thinking styles, see John Maxwells book on [How Successful People think](https://www.amazon.com/How-Successful-People-Think-Thinking/dp/1599951681/)

## Innovation Mindset
> "Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower." - Steve Jobs

> "We know that leadership is very much related to change. As the pace of change accelerates, there is naturally a greater need for effective leadership." - John Kotter

Innovation Mindset is another key attribute of distinction for a technology leader. Innovation often means tremendous risks and requires courage and perseverance. Innovation is closely related to the first attribute of Vision.

In technology, there are many opportunities for a leader to do transformational innovation due to the nature and pace of evolution of technology. It is often about taking something that has always been there and doing in a fresh and new way with the technology of today. A leader who can embrace innovation and change will excel in technology.

While vision defines the idea in a bright, clear and aspirational manner, execution is a key ingredient for innovation.

Execution in Innovation is often about change & transformation. John Kotter's [8 steps to Change](https://www.kotterinternational.com/8-steps-process-for-leading-change/)  is an essential tool for some one who is looking to be effective in Innovation and Change.

The book [The Innovators Mindset](https://www.amazon.com/The-Innovators-Mindset-Learning-Creativity/dp/0986155497/) focuses on developing a mindset for Innovation (In the education space, but applicable in all areas)

## Communication
> "Ask not what your country can do for you — ask what you can do for your country" - John F. Kennedy

> "Great leaders are almost always great simplifiers, who can cut through argument, debate, and doubt to offer a solution everybody can understand." — General Colin Powell

> "An iPod, a phone, an internet mobile communicator… An iPod, a phone, an internet mobile communicator… An iPod, a phone, an internet mobile communicator… Do you get it? These are not three separated devices. This is one device, and we are calling it iPhone." - Steve Jobs

Leaders need to develop skills to achieve action through powerful verbal and written communications.

Great communication invokes inspiration and action. In the field of rhetoric this is called Perlocutionary effect of the communication. Vision and Innovation (First 2 Attributes) both need to be communicated effectively to be useful.

A leader also needs to be *Chaos to Clarity transformer* - able to take in information at a rapid pace in Chaotic situations, analyze them and provide directions to simplify and solve the problem. A very effective method for doing is *"Framework thinking"*, a concept I introduce and discuss in a future article.

## Temperament (Leadership Temperament)

An effective leader needs to have Temperament that project a sense of calm, confidence, thoughtfulness and stability. John Maxwell calls this the law of the Solid ground. Many things can and will go wrong and steady leadership in these difficult situations is essential to success.

## Ownership
> The Buck Stops Here - Harry S Truman

> When you’re a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you’re not going to use a piece of plywood on the back. - Steve Jobs

Ability to persevere, and grit to achieve the vision through strong ownership. Ownership also enables leaders to maintain quality, design and pride in what ever they are leading.

Another key aspect of ownership is passion. With out passion, ownership is tough to maintain. Therefore leaders typically excel in their leadership when they are working on things they are passionate about.

## Relationships
> “Relationship skills are the most important ability in leadership” - John Maxwell

> Leaders don't create followers, they create more leaders - Tom Peters

Relationships are built through **trust**, nurtured through genuine **care** for the others and their well being. A leader makes those around them considerably better than they are in the absence of the leader. Also please trust leaders who demonstrate **integrity** and clear **principles**.

A successful leader needs to consider relationships as a true asset to themselves and those around them and need to nurture and develop these relationships on a daily basis.

## Intuition
> “You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.” ~ Steve Jobs

A leader needs to have good intuition. Intuition comes from experience and ability to quickly detect patterns and store them away for the future. Intuition shortcuts exhaustive collection of data and analysis to make quick decisions by mental visualization, scenario planning and application of probabilities.

The article by Kate Nasser [link](http://katenasser.com/new-leaders-develop-your-intuition/) has a great summary on leadership intuition.
> Intuition is a synthesis of information and experience — especially about people — reapplied in a different time and space
