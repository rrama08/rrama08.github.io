# Better Agile
I have been lately doing some thinking on a better approach for integration of holistic systems thinking and architecture into agile execution. Some of the key principles of this light weight architecture approach are:

1. Architecture is a collaborative process.
2. Think at a system level, act locally.
3. Preserve optionality on some design decisions, but take some design decisions early to reduce ambiguity.
4. Architecture should be done iteratively (No big Upfront Design) and should be weaved into the execution process.
5. Keep a catalog of architecture decisions as a fluent list. They exist but they may change.
