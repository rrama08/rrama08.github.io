> If we encounter a man of rare intellect, we should ask him what books he reads - Ralph Waldo Emerson

Is there a better way to read non-fiction and business books which dramatically increases our comprehension and knowledge? Is the traditional linear reading the most effective way of reading a book? How can I retain all the information in a book in my mind when I need them?

I started with these questions and after thinking and tweaking for several years, I have created an approach that dramatically improves the quality of reading for any non-fiction reader. I call this **Impactful Reading**

# *SIMPLE™️* Framework for Impactful Reading

The following are the six steps to more effective reading. I have arranged these steps into an easy to remember framework called SIMPLE. The following diagram summarizes the framework.

## Selection
Selecting a book that you want to read in a proactive manner.

## Input
Consuming the contents of the book in an intentional structured manner that is ideal for non-fiction reading.

## Memorization
A book is only useful if you can memorize and recall it. Memorization also helps you think about the book in your mind and further enhance your level of knowledge about the concepts in the book.

## Processing
Processing enables you to strengthen your understanding of the book and prepare the concepts for application when you need them.

## Linking
Linking is required to truly associate the book to your existing knowledge base and locks it into your long term memory.

## Expression
Expression trains your mind to use the concepts in a conscious and sub conscious manner. Along with Processing and linking, it helps in ready recall and utilization.

In each of the remaining chapters we will explore these concepts one by one. This will elevate your level of reading comprehension and ability to recall as well as utilize the concepts in any non-fiction book dramatically.
