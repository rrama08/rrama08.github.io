  </header>

  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Often, Digital strategies that companies follow have a unitary focus toward Customer interaction and related interfaces only. <strong>My View: A true Digital Enterprise must leverage Digital for all its interaction points - Customers, Employees and Suppliers/Partners</strong> . I propose the Delta Framework for Digital strategy.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/holisticdigital.png" alt="Delta Framework Image" /></p>

<h1 id="customer-facing">Customer Facing</h1>
<p>Customer interaction is definitely the most important or leading initiative for any digital transformation. The focus areas for an effective Digital Strategy for Customer should include:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>An optimized customer journey</strong> - Supported by Digital technology with true Omni-Channel awareness and interaction in a seamless manner. Seamless integration with Social Media where majority of the Digital enterprises customer’s spend significant chunk of their digital time.</li>
  <li><strong>Predictive and Prescriptive Interactions</strong> - Digital enables the enterprise to collect massive amounts of Data about their customers. Using enabling technologies like Big Data, Fast Data, and Intelligent Computing (Machine Learning, AI), enterprises should enable the customers to experience true benefits of Digital with a deeper knowledge of the customer.</li>
  <li><strong>API Integration</strong> - Customers may not always spend their in the enterprises digital assets or interfaces. The modern competitive digital enterprise must enable and encourage Digital Collaborative Interfaces - 3rd party aggregator apps, sites etc to interact via APIs so that the digital interaction may result in a business transaction with the enterprise through its APIs.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="employee-facing">Employee Facing</h1>
<p>All Modern Digital enterprises have a problem and an opportunity. All or most of their new employees are millennials, who grew up in the digital world. Their expectations of companies internal systems are much more sophisticated. A truly effective digital enterprise will view this as an opportunity to attract the best and brightest employees by offering a delightful digital employee journey</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Modern CRM systems</strong> - For effective and holistic customer management and support, Customer life time value analysis and life cycle management</li>
  <li><strong>Digital HCM and Employee Journey</strong> - Through the complete journey of the employee through the enterprise with streamlined recruiting, on-boarding, performance management, self service etc the enterprise must provide effective digital interfaces for their employees</li>
  <li><strong>Financial Systems</strong> - For the finance Department of the company to effectively conduct their work with GL, AR/AP etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Supplier Management Systems</strong> - To effectively manage the companies suppliers</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="supplier-or-partner-facing">Supplier or Partner Facing</h1>
<p>This is the last face of the digital enterprise facing its suppliers and partners. The Digital enterprise must enable effective systems for all aspects of the supplier interfaces that will give it true differentiation from its competitors.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Digital Supply Chain</strong> - Digital interface to manage the supply chain, PO Process, Shipping notifications etc where the suppliers and the employees can collaborate.</li>
  <li><strong>Invoicing, AR/AP</strong> - Streamlined interfaces for suppliers to submit invoices, track AP status etc</li>
  <li><strong>API Based connectivity</strong> - Interfaces for automated integration of all aspects of the supply chain. Modern form of Digital EDI.</li>
  <li><strong>Digital Supplier Hubs</strong> - The most effective of the enterprises will establish Digital supplier hubs that can act as trading platforms, where suppliers can compete against each other to satisfy the enterprises needs.</li>
</ol>

<p>In order to support and enable these 3 Faces of a Holistic Digital enterprise, the enterprise must develop the following key competencies.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Digital Technology Expertise</strong> - Mobile, Responsive Web, Single Page Architectures, Server less architectures, Micro Services, Social Integration etc form the arsenal of tools and techniques necessary for implementing effective digital enterprises</li>
  <li><strong>API Management</strong> - Expertise in creating and managing APIs for all aspects of core capabilities of the enterprise.</li>
  <li><strong>Big Data/Fast Data</strong> - Due to the enormous volume and velocity of the data generated by a digital enterprise, expertise in collecting and leveraging this data in both real-time and batch modes is critical.</li>
  <li><strong>AI &amp; Machine Learning</strong> - Leverage the Data collected for supervised learning systems to enable more sophisticated predictive and prescriptive interfaces with all faces (Customers, Employees, Suppliers) is another core capability.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="why-delta">Why Delta?</h1>
<p>Delta creates a  virtuous cycle of Business performance by connecting together the most important constituents - Customers, Employees and Suppliers all into improved performance.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Customers are more satisfied and conduct more transactions with the business improving top line revenue.</li>
  <li>Employees are happy, serves the customers better, are more productive and results in improved SG&amp;A.</li>
  <li>Suppliers are able to conduct their business more efficiently, optimizing all aspects of supply chain, reducing overall COGS.</li>
</ul>
