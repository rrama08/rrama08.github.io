    <p>Frameworking™️ is a way of structuring the thinking process and expression of ideas in a visual manner. Many of the viral and successfully diffused ideas are structured as frameworks.</p>

<p>for e.g. One of the most famous strategy frameworks is the five forces framework by Potter. This framework expresses the competitive strategy approach used by firms to improve their position with in a industry.</p>

<p>Another popular framework is the 7 habits of Highly effective people by Steven Covey. Covey uses both an enumeration technique (7 habits) as well as a visual diagram to communicate his framework.</p>

<p>These frameworks are able to communicate complex concepts in a simple, memorable and thought provoking manner. We will explore how to build frameworks like these in the next section of the article.</p>

<h1 id="why-frameworking">Why Frameworking?</h1>

<h2 id="framework-for-higher-order-thinking">Framework for Higher Order Thinking</h2>
<p>Thinking in the form of a framework will enable the thinker to fine tune the idea or concept and sharpen its foundation incrementally till it is rock solid. It also allows looking at the idea or concept from multiple angles to make sure all conceptual aspects are considered and structured in an easy to understand, digest and remember form. It elevates thinking from a simple linear approach to multi-dimensional and relational thinking - considering dimensions against each other and their relationships to each other.</p>

<h2 id="framework-as-powerful-expression-tool">Framework as Powerful expression tool</h2>
<p>Framework is a great communication tool and a visual language for expression of ideas. Expressing ideas as framework provides a way to concisely express the core of the idea in a single diagram or structure that conveys information at high density to the consumers of the framework.</p>

<p>Framework also enables easy memorization of the core concepts conveyed through a framework. This type of memorization enables association of more facts, ideas and additional concepts attached to the framework.</p>

<h2 id="framework-as-a-thought-multiplier">Framework as a Thought Multiplier</h2>
<p>Another aspect of a framework that is interesting is the ability of the framework to act as a multiplier of thoughts to the consumer of the framework. A properly constructed framework inspires thinking by the consumer of the framework to add their own experiences, anecdotes, facts etc to the concept conveyed in the framework.</p>

<h1 id="frameworking-techniques">Frameworking Techniques</h1>

<p>I love creating frameworks. Some of the frameworks I have externally published are available at <a href="http://www.ramachandran.io">ramachandran.io</a>.
In this article, I will provide a meta-framework for creating your own frameworks. This enables, any concept to be conveyed in a manner that is 10x more effective that simple textual or verbal communication of the same concept.</p>

<p>The Meta-Framework is called CEO method to frameworking. C for Conceptualization, E for expression and O for Optimization. A framework needs careful thought, expression and optimization in order for it to be useful.</p>

<p>The following diagram shows the CEO method.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ceomethod.png" alt="CEO Method for Frameworking" /></p>

<h2 id="conceptualization">Conceptualization</h2>

<p>During this stage, the core idea needs to be defined and developed. 3 Steps can be used to achieve this.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Define</strong> - Achieve clarity on the core idea for frameworking. Can be defined by writing out a statement of the core idea.</li>
  <li><strong>Breakdown</strong> - This step involves breaking down the core idea into as many component parts as possible. An approach called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MECE_principle">MECE</a> (Mutually exclusive Collectively Exhaustive) is popular in the consulting world. Also any relevant dimensions that are interesting for the concept needs to be identified. For e.g. Looking at Leadership along dimensions of directive vs supporting behavior of leaders (Approach used in Situational leadership).</li>
  <li><strong>Relationships and Grouping</strong> - The next step involves, creating as many relationships and structure among components as possible.</li>
</ol>

<p>A popular method that can be used for all three of these steps is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map">Mind mapping</a> (An approach created by Tony Buzan). A cloud based software program that I typically used for this is <a href="https://coogle.it">Coogle</a>.</p>

<h2 id="expression">Expression</h2>

<p>Once the concept is understood in a very thorough fashion during the conceptualization stage, the next stage is to take the concept and package it in a manner that is easily consumable by others. This step involved fitting and shaping the elements of the concept into one of the expression techniques. There are primarily 8 different techniques for expression.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dimensional Analysis</strong> - Dimensional Analysis involved looking at some interesting dimensions of a concept and then looking at the interplay between these dimensions. a Good example of this is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth–share_matrix">BCG Growth Share Matrix</a>. In this method, the x-axis represents the Relative market share and the y-axis represents the Market growth rate. The relationship between the two creates an interesting way to position the business units with in a company into categories (Dogs, Stars, Cash Cows and Question Marks)
<img src="/assets/images/frameworking/bcg.png" alt="BCG Growth Share Matrix" /></p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Pyramid Structure</strong> - A Pyramid Structure is represented by a triangle with multiple horizontal segments or Tiers. Very useful to explain concepts where something generic is represented by the base of the pyramid and the tip of the pyramid represents something most specific. Competency models are perfect examples of this approach. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs">Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs</a> is a good example of this.
<img src="/assets/images/frameworking/maslow.png" alt="Maslow" /></li>
  <li><strong>Enumeration</strong> - Enumeration is a technique to arrange the concepts in a framework into a numerical order. A good example of this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People">7 Habits of Highly Effective People</a> by Steven Covey.
<img src="/assets/images/frameworking/7Habits.png" alt="7 Habits" /></li>
  <li><strong>Mnemonic Fiiting</strong> - Another common approach is to fit the concepts into a easily recallable mnemonic device. Chip and Dan Heath’s <a href="http://heathbrothers.com/books/made-to-stick/">Made to Stick</a> uses a mnemonic device “SUCCES” to convey their framework for creating truly sticky and viral ideas.
<img src="/assets/images/frameworking/SUCCES.png" alt="SUCCES" /></li>
  <li><strong>Sequencing</strong> - Sequencing is arranging components of the framework in a simple sequence that is intuitive to make sense to the consumer of the framework. Kotter’s <a href="https://www.leadershipthoughts.com/kotters-8-step-change-model/">8 Steps to Change</a> is an example of sequencing and enumeration combined.</li>
  <li><strong>Virtuous Circles</strong> - Virtuous circles are set of concepts that reinforce and improve each other creating a virtuous effect of improvement. Bain and Company’s <a href="http://www.bain.com/consulting-services/customer-strategy-and-marketing/">Customer wheel</a> is an example of this framework.
<img src="/assets/images/frameworking/customerwheel.png" alt="Customer Wheel" /></li>
  <li><strong>Venn Diagram</strong> - Another way to convey a concept is to show an intersection between the various groups to show an overlapping relationship between them. It is great at visually organizing information and useful especially with sets to communicate overlap. Jim Collin’s <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/hedgehog-concept.htm">Hedgehog concept</a> from the book “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Good-Great-Some-Companies-Others-ebook/dp/B0058DRUV6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1504544335&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=good+to+great">Good to Great</a>” is a good example of this.
<img src="/assets/images/frameworking/Hedgehog-Concept.png" alt="Hedgehog Concept" /></li>
  <li><strong>Hybrid/Composite</strong> - Some concepts are too complex to represent with these foundational representation. So they either use a combination of these methods to represent this concept. Good example of this is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_chain">Value Chain framework</a> by Potter.
<img src="/assets/images/frameworking/PorterValueChain.png" alt="Porter's Value Chain" /></li>
</ol>

<p>My own meta-framework on Frameworking in this article uses a combination of several techniques</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mnemonic Fitting (CEO)</li>
  <li>Sequence - Part of the conceptualization stage</li>
  <li>Enumeration - Techniques for expressing framework</li>
  <li>Virtuous Circle - Optimization stage</li>
</ul>

<p>Beyond these techniques there are several other techniques not covered here including tree structures, layer cakes, geographic fitting (Triangles, hexagons, pentagons) etc. The key is to understand using diagramming techniques to clearly convey the idea is a way that is so simple and  effective.</p>

<h2 id="optimization">Optimization</h2>
<p>The last step of frameworking is to optimize the concept and the expression of the concept to make it crystal clear and memorable for the consumers of the framework.</p>

<p>The following are the steps that form a virtuous circle:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Review the framework for the following
    <ul>
      <li>Is it conveying the idea effectively?</li>
      <li>Is it conveying the idea concisely?</li>
      <li>Is it conveying the idea in a memorable manner?</li>
      <li>Does it make the audience think?</li>
      <li>Does it make the audience share?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Pitch the framework to others to get initial feedback</li>
  <li>Incorporate feedback from test pitches and make changes</li>
  <li>Iterate steps 1-3 till it is good enough to publish</li>
  <li>Publish in your blog, company presentation or other forum.</li>
  <li>Keep using the framework at any opportunity you have. Continue to fine tune as you get more feedback about this.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="in-conclusion">In Conclusion</h1>
<p>I hope this meta-framework gave you a good foundation to building your own frameworks that inspire people. If you liked this article, please share with others who may find it useful. Thank you for reading. Also any feedback in the comments section will be appreciated.</p>
