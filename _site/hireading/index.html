<blockquote>
  <p>If we encounter a man of rare intellect, we should ask him what books he reads - Ralph Waldo Emerson</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there a better way to read non-fiction and business books which dramatically increases our comprehension and knowledge? Is the traditional linear reading the most effective way of reading a book? How can I retain all the information in a book in my mind when I need them?</p>

<p>I started with these questions and after thinking and tweaking for several years, I have created an approach that dramatically improves the quality of reading for any non-fiction reader. I call this <strong>High Impact Reading</strong></p>

<h1 id="simple️-framework-for-high-impact-reading"><em>SIMPLE™️</em> Framework for High Impact Reading</h1>

<p>The following are the six steps to more effective reading. I have arranged these steps into an easy to remember framework called SIMPLE. The following diagram summarizes the framework.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/SIMPLE.png" alt="SIMPLE framework" /></p>

<h2 id="s---selection">S - Selection</h2>
<p>The beginning of High Impact Reading is to identify the books that you want to fully commit to reading thoroughly and really get organized about this.</p>

<h3 id="be-strategic">Be Strategic</h3>
<p>Identify the topics and areas that will benefit you most and aligns the most with your growth goals. for e.g. If you are a new manager or leader in your organization, you may want to select leadership related books and strategic frameworks etc. This will be much more satisfying that randomly picking up books to read.</p>

<h3 id="be-selective">Be Selective</h3>
<p>Even with in the strategic areas you have picked, identify high quality books. High quality books often have the following Attributes</p>
<ul>
  <li>They have strong core concepts.</li>
  <li>They are well organized, typically around a framework.</li>
  <li>They have good ratings on amazon and other stores.</li>
  <li>They are linked and quoted. This can be identified with a google search on the topic</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="create-a-reading-pipeline">Create a reading Pipeline</h3>
<p>Build a pipeline of books that you would like to read and keep this list maintained. A good start of the pipeline is to note the following information as a part of each entry of the pipeline</p>

<ul>
  <li>Name &amp; Author - Name of the book and the author.</li>
  <li>Discovery - How did you discover this book?</li>
  <li>Purpose - Why should you read this book?</li>
  <li>Interest - Why do you find this book interesting?</li>
  <li>Status - Pending, In Progress, Completed</li>
  <li>Date - When did you add this book to the pipeline?</li>
  <li>Action Date - When did you complete this book?</li>
</ul>

<p>By creating this basic information about the books in your reading pipeline, you are crystal clear about why these books must be read. You can create a simple spreadsheet in google sheets or an excel spreadsheet to create the pipeline</p>

<h2 id="i---input">I - Input</h2>
<p>The next step of SIMPLE framework is the Input. This is the most time consuming stage of the reading process. 3 Ways to better input while reading are:-</p>

<h3 id="non-linear-reading">Non-Linear Reading</h3>
<p>People often read a book starting with the cover, then going to the next pages one by one, till they get to the last page. This is the only way to read a fiction book and a very <strong>ineffective</strong> way of reading a non-fiction book. Linear reading can make the process of reading a large book almost insurmountable. The <strong>Non-linear reading</strong> technique is much more effective and less time consuming. Here are the basic steps of non-linear reading</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Cover Reading</strong> Read the front and back of the book. Read about the author, what other books they have written and their area of expertise. Is this book worth reading? If not stop now.</li>
  <li><strong>Table of Content Reading</strong> Read the table of contents of the book. Understand the skeleton structure of the book. Again look at the conceptual density and quality of the book. Is this book worth reading? If not stop.</li>
  <li><strong>Early Reflection</strong> Close the book now, and think about why you should read this book. What concepts from this book will help you (from just reading the table of contents of the book). If you are convinced this book will be helpful, now you are ready to commit time and energy to fully reading, understanding and adding this book to your knowledge base. You are now fully receptive to the content of the book.</li>
  <li><strong>Structural Reading</strong> Now, comes the structural reading. Read each chapter by dedicating at most 5 minutes to the chapter. for a 12 chapter book, this will take only 1 hour and give you a great sense of knowledge and confidence about the book.
    <ul>
      <li>Read the Title - What is this chapter about?</li>
      <li>Read the main headings and sub-headings in the chapter. What are the main ideas conveyed in this chapter?</li>
      <li>Scan the first couple of lines of paragraph of each heading, sub-heading of the chapter. Resist the impulse to read the entire section.</li>
      <li>Read any summary of the chapter if provided in the book. Think about the concepts conveyed in the chapter.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Finding the Skeleton</strong> - Now look for the skeleton structure of the concept in the book by skimming through the book. Some books have explicit framework conveyed through a diagram or a simple to follow mnemonic. Go through this framework thoroughly. What would you like to understand about this framework? How does it make sense? How does the components of the framework link together? Thinking about it this way raises your curiosity and anticipation in reading the book making your mind more receptive to the knowledge contained in this book.</li>
  <li><strong>Chapter reading - finally!!</strong> - Now you are ready to read the chapters. Based on the Skeleton, you may want to read certain chapter that raised your curiosity the most. You may also want to read the last chapter first. This gives a sense of accomplishment of having gone to the end of the book. Or you can read one chapter at a time. I personally speed read each chapter and go through chapters with high concept-density multiple times.</li>
  <li><strong>Reflect and Review</strong> - You are not done yet. Reflect on what you have understood from this book. Read the table of contents again and try to mentally play back what each concept means and how they are linked together.</li>
  <li><strong>Optional - Reading backwards</strong> - This is an optional step that builds your mastery of the book further. Skim through chapters front to back. Try to fit the concepts to each other as you do this step. This should not take more than a few minutes.</li>
</ol>

<p>Congratulations! - At this point you should feel a real sense of mastery about the book.</p>

<h3 id="multi-modal-input">Multi-Modal Input</h3>
<p>Now it is time to layer in your understanding of the book with other forms of input. Search in youtube for any videos or related speeches on the book and view them. Look for Slideshare.com to see if some body has created a summary of this book. Look for enhancement of concepts from the book. All this reinforces your understanding of the book. You do not need to spend more than 15 min to 30 minutes on this activity.</p>

<h3 id="multi-sourcing">Multi-Sourcing</h3>
<p>Look for other books on this same topic. Scan these books if they are readily available, with out spending more than 15-20 minutes per book. If these is some concept in these books that raise your curiosity, then deep dive into it.</p>

<p>Now you are ready to go to the next step.</p>

<h2 id="m---memorization">M - Memorization</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Reading a book with out being able to recall it when needed is like depositing money into a bank with out being able to withdraw it. - Renjith Ramachandran</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Use one of the following techniques to memorize the concepts in the book. After you master these approach it will typically only take 10-15 minutes to remember the concepts of any book.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Flash Cards</strong> - Create flash cards for each concept in the book an arrange them together. The act of creating the cards and review using the cards will help you memorize the book.</li>
  <li><strong>Roman Room Technique</strong> - A common technique used by memory champions to remember a deck of cards or 100 digits of PI etc. My personal favorite that I have used to remember several books. See <a href="http://www.thememoryinstitute.com/loci-the-roman-room-and-the-familiar-path.html">link</a> for more details</li>
  <li><strong>Mmenonics</strong> - Some books already contain pre-packaged mnemonics. This enables you to remember these books easily. For e.g The SUCCES mnemonic in “Made to Stick by Chip and Dan Heath”. if not, try to create your own mnemonic that help you recall the book.</li>
</ul>

<p>I personally spend only 5-10 minutes to memorize the concepts in a book using the Roman room technique.</p>

<h2 id="p---processing">P - Processing</h2>
<p>The next step to High impact reading is to process in your mind what you have read. To be truly effective with this, you need to have successfully completed the memorization step. Here are 5 ways to process the book in your mind further.</p>

<h3 id="thinking">Thinking</h3>
<p>Take any free time you have, while driving, subway etc, to think what you have read in the book. Play back in your mind concepts of the book. Ask yourself questions</p>

<ul>
  <li>Why does the ideas conveyed in this book make sense?</li>
  <li>How does his book help advance the topic?</li>
  <li>Do I agree with this book. If yes Why? If not Why not?</li>
  <li>How can I use the concepts I have learned from this book?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="transformation">Transformation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>How would I adapt or transform the concepts in this book to make them more powerful or applicable to my own industry or Context?</li>
  <li>What would I change about the concepts presented in the book?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="association">Association</h3>
<ul>
  <li>How can I associate the concepts in this book to other ideas I know about the topic?</li>
  <li>Are there conflicts with my existing knowledge or does it fit nicely?</li>
</ul>

<p>The association step will also be helpful during the Linking stage of SIMPLE framework.</p>

<h3 id="stretching">Stretching</h3>
<ul>
  <li>How would I add to the concept if I were the author?</li>
  <li>What other areas can I use these concepts in, that the author had not thought about?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mind-mapping">Mind mapping</h3>
<p>This is something that you can do when you are in front of a computer. Use a mind mapping tool such as “Coggle” (My favorite) to visually link the concepts in the book to the other additional ideas you have developed about the book.</p>

<h2 id="l---linking">L - Linking</h2>
<p>This step is very important to long term memory of the contents and the concepts of the book. Memory is all about associating the new information with information you already know. Linking can be done with the following.</p>

<h3 id="fitting">Fitting</h3>
<p>This step involves fitting the book into your existing knowledge structure. Where does this new information fit? How does it relate to the ideas that I already know? You will need to rely on your existing knowledge and associate this new knowledge to the existing knowledge.</p>

<h3 id="frameworking">Frameworking</h3>
<p>Often, associating the knowledge that you have about a topic into a broad framework and placing the new knowledge into that framework is an effective method for linking for long term memory. A simple framework is a tree structure with some classification of the various concepts you know about the topic. For example, I put the 5 Leadership frameworks I like into a pentagon structure. This includes my own <a href="/victori">VICTORI</a> framework</p>

<h3 id="review">Review</h3>
<p>Review is a key element to linking. Periodically, review the concept structure in the book that was memorized during the memorization step as well as Fitting and Frameworking that was done as a part of the Linking step. Then review the way this is linked to existing knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="e---expression">E - Expression</h2>
<p>The final step in the mastery of the concepts related to the book is to express these ideas yourself (Output). Use simple techniques to output your knowledge about the book and the concepts from the book. This can be done using</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Private</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Your own private notes on the book</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Public</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Something as simple as a tweet about the concepts of the book</li>
      <li>Facebook or linked-in post about the book</li>
      <li>Blogging about the book in your blog</li>
      <li>Creating a podcast about the ideas in the book</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Elevate your understanding further by creating your own derivatives of the ideas contained in the book. Create your own framework on the concepts.</p>

<p>Depending upon the method used, this step can take anywhere from 5 minutes to few hours of your time, with increasing returns depending upon the time and effort.</p>

<h1 id="in-summary">In summary</h1>
<p>Congratulations!! - By reading this article you have mastered an excellent #lifehacking #metaskill. You can master any book and elevate your level of thinking 100x. A book read using this approach will provide you returns over a life time. Here is a Detailed version of the SIMPLE framework diagram.</p>
